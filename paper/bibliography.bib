	            appears to be an extremely hard yet interesting problem. In this
	            article, we present a pedagogical overview of the origin of the
	            sign problem in various quantum Monte Carlo simulation techniques
	            , ranging from the world-line and stochastic series expansion
	            Monte Carlo for boson and spin systems to the determinant and
	            momentum-space quantum Monte Carlo for interacting fermions. We
	            point out the basis dependency of the sign problem and summarize
	            the progresses to cure, ease and even make use of the sign
	            problem over the years, such as symmetry analysis of the
	            underlying Hamiltonian, basis optimization in writing down the
	            partition functions and many others. Moreover, we state that
	            although traditional lore says that in the case of sign problem,
	            the average sign in QMC simulation approaches zero exponentially
	            fast with the space-time volume of the configurational space,
	            there are recent breakthroughs showing this is not always the
	            case. Based on the properties of the partition function for
	            finite size systems, one could distinguish when the average sign
	            has the usual exponential scaling and when it is bestowed with an
	            algebraic scaling at the low-temperature limit. Fermionic QMC
	            simulations with such algebraic sign problems have been
	            successfully carried out for extended Hubbard-type and quantum
	            Moiré lattice models.},

	            (stochastic series expansion) algorithms and their computer
	            implementations are then discussed in detail. Applications of the
	            methods are illustrated by results for some of the most essential
	            models in quantum magnetism, such as the S = 1/2 Heisenberg
	            antiferromagnet in one and two dimensions, as well as extended
	            models useful for studying quantum phase transitions between
	            antiferromagnetic and magnetically disordered states.},
