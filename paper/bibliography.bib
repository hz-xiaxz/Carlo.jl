	            offering flexible and efficient handling of tabular data sets in
	            memory. Thanks to Julia’s unique strengths, it provides an
	            appealing set of features: Rich support for standard data
	            processing tasks and excellent flexibility and efficiency for
	            more advanced and non-standard operations. We present the
	            fundamental design of the package and how it compares with
	            implementations of data frames in other languages, its main
	            features, performance, and possible extensions. We conclude with
	            a practical illustration of typical data processing operations.},
