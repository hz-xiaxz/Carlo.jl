Carlo is a framework for developing high-performance, distributed (quantum) Monte Carlo simultations.
Its aim is to take care of model-independent tasks such as

* autocorrelation and error analysis,
* Monte-Carlo-aware MPI scheduling, and
* checkpointing

while leaving all the flexibility of implementating Monte Carlo updates and estimators to you.


## Getting started

To install the package, type

```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add("https://github.com/lukas-weber/Carlo.jl")
```

The package itself does not include Monte Carlo algorithms. You can test the [Ising](https://github.com/lukas-weber/Ising.jl) or the (not yet released) [StochasticSeriesExpansion](https://github.com/lukas-weber/StochasticSeriesExpansion.jl) packages. The former is a particularly easy example you can use as a template for writing your own algorithms.
